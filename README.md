# üêæ Multi-Class Animal Image Classification

A deep learning project for classifying animal images into multiple categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model can identify animals like dogs, cats, horses, elephants, and more.

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to build and train an image classification model that can accurately classify images of animals into multiple categories. It involves data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction using a labeled dataset.

## üß† Features

- Multi-class classification of animal images.
- Custom CNN or pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet).
- Real-time prediction on new images.
- Model performance evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Optionally, a simple web interface for uploading and classifying images.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- OpenCV or PIL (for image processing)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- Flask / Streamlit (optional for deployment)
